SQLBuilder is a Java library which aims to be a better PreparedStatement. It was developed internally at MetricStream
and is in active use and maintained by MetricStream. We use lots of wonderful open source code in our projects and open
sourcing this library is an attempt to give a tiny bit back to the community. Hopefully someone will find it useful.
Feedback of and kind is definitely appreciated!

Currently, to use SQLBuilder in your Java project you must download or clone this repository and then run `./gradlew
jar` to create the `sqlbuilder-core-1.0.0.jar` and `sqlbuilder-mock-1.0.0.jar` libraries. In the near future we will
publish them to [MavenCentral] for easier consumption and then update these instructions.Stya tuned!

Read the [documentation](docs/Rationale.md) for details on why and how to use SQLBuilder.
